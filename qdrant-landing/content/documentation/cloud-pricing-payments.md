# Qdrant Cloud Billing & Payments

Qdrant database clusters in Qdrant Cloud are priced based on CPU, memory, and disk storage usage. To get a clearer idea for the pricing structure, based on the amounts of vectors you want to store, please use our [Pricing Calculator](https://cloud.qdrant.io/calculator).

## Billing

You can pay for your Qdrant Cloud database clusters either with a credit card or through an AWS, GCP, or Azure Marketplace subscription.

Your payment method is charged at the beginning of each month for the previous month's usage. There is no difference in pricing between the different payment methods.

If you choose to pay through a marketplace, the Qdrant Cloud usage costs are added as usage units to your existing billing for your cloud provider services. A detailed breakdown of your usage is available in the Qdrant Cloud Console.

Note: Even if you pay using a marketplace subscription, your database clusters will still be deployed into Qdrant-owned infrastructure. The setup and management of Qdrant database clusters will also still be done via the Qdrant Cloud Console UI.

If you wish to deploy Qdrant database clusters into your own environment from Qdrant Cloud then we recommend our [Hybrid Cloud](/documentation/hybrid-cloud/) solution.
