# User Management

> ðŸ’¡ You can access this in **Access Management > User & Role Management** *if available see [this page for details](/documentation/cloud-rbac/).*

## Inviting Users to an Account

Users can be invited via the **User Management** section, where they are assigned the **Base role** by default. Additionally, users have the option to select a specific role when inviting another user. The **Base role** is a predefined role with minimal permissions, granting users access to the platform while restricting them to viewing only their own profile.

### Inviting Users from a Role

Users can be invited attached to a specific role by inviting them through theÂ **Role Details**Â page - just click on the Users tab and follow the prompts.

Once accepted, they'll be assigned that role's permissions, along with the base role.
